<h4><a name="My research"></a>My research</h4>

A brief summary of his projects/publications are:

1. [Apache SystemML](http://systemml.apache.org/) provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed computations on Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
2. [Spoken Topic Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2FxQvYQhnAcZmkwdU5JQ3Q3eVk/view?usp=sharing) is a novel topic model for spoken language that incorporates a statistical model of speech-to-text software behavior .
3. The paper [Pansare et al, VLDB 2011](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2FxQvYQhnAcNGoyTWFaOW5uWVE/view?usp=sharing) describes how online aggregation can be built into a MapReduce system for large-scale data processing.
4. [Datapath system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2FxQvYQhnAcQW4wd3hYRkdQX1k/view?usp=sharing) is a relational multi-query database system capable of providing single-query performance even for large number of parallel and possibly different queries.

<h4><a name="About me"></a>About me</h4>

Before coming to Rice university, I got my Bachelors in Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai and my Masters in Computer Engineering from University of Florida. After my undergrad, I worked as software developer for MAQSoftware, Mumbai for 8 months and have also done summer internships with Microsoft, Seattle and IBM Research, Delhi. I am recipient of IBM PhD fellowship for the year 2013-14 and was first overall coordinator of Rice Computer Science Graduate Student Association (CS GSA). During my third year at Rice, I was President and (hence de-facto) captain of my university cricket team (RCC) and also was in the committee of Indian Student Association at Rice (ISAR).
